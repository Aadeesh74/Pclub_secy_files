To scrape given page https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/ just open secy.py and run this.
for any another page similar to this just replace that link with line 4 in secy.py i.e page = requests.get("your page link addres").
for part 2 of question I provided csv file that was outputted by last program.
for testyu.py to work simply rename your json file as students.json and csv file as pclub.csv and put both files in same directory in which you download or clone testyu.py and run the program.
To run any .py file you need python installed in your pc and you can directly run using command prompt/terminal .
